# Matrix Transpose in C# on different platforms

We use a matrix transpose, written in C#, to generate a single binary, transport it to multiple platforms *after compilation* and execute it either with .NET or Mono.

First we see a Tesla GPU on Windows

See how the Titan performs slightly better than the Tesla. That is due to the higher frequency. This speed-up does come with the cost of reduced longevity though.

Next, we run on Linux again on a Titan. As we can see, the Linux-based implementation achieves good results on Mono.

On iMac, there is now the built-in GPU in it. The performance is smaller than the one measured on the high-end Tesla and Titan cards.

And last but not least, we run on the Tegra K1 development board on an ARM processor. The Tegra machine is to be considered an embedded system and as such, the achieved performance is very good. And also much less power-intensive than the corresponding CPU implementation.
