<tr><th>Term</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>
<tr><td>CUDA</td><td> CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing
platform and programming model created by NVIDIA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>PTX</td><td> A low-level parallel thread execution virtual machine and an instruction
set architecture (ISA) used by CUDA. PTX code is architecture specific,
but not device specific. It is JIT compiled to executable device specific
machine code at run time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>LLVM</td><td> LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine) is a compiler infrastructure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>LLVM IR</td><td> The intermediate representation of LLVM. It works as a virtual machine
assembly language. It is generated from a high level language by a
front-end and compiled into native code or an other language by a back-end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>NVVM</td><td> A compiler infrastructure, created by NVIDIA, built upon LLVM to
translate a subset of LLVM IR (NVVM IR) into PTX.</td></tr>
<tr><td>NVVM IR</td><td> A GPU target specific subset of the LLVM internal representation (IR).</td></tr>
