# Developing For Multiple Platforms

For GPU software development there are additional aspects that contribute to a "platform".

A normal program only needs to take into account the platform and the bitness. A GPU program also has a bitness. Moreover, it has different drivers on different platforms and it may require different compute capabilities to execute. 

Alea GPU deals with all of these aspects by allowing you to embed GPU binaries for the different bitnesses and compute capabilites into your own program.

In case of the default AOT compilation, for each combination of bitness and compute capability you request, the AOT compiler will invoke your `GPUModule` and allow you to use different settings for your kernels. This allows for very powerful compile-time meta-programming akin to C++ template meta-programming. With Alea GPU it is quite feasible to have special, highly optimized implementations of kernels for each different machine architecture fully embedded into your program, so that you can provide top-notch performance in a wide range of GPU and host combinations.

In case you choose JIT compilation, only the combination of compute capability and bitness that is relevant in your scenario is actually compiled, thus reducing overhead.
