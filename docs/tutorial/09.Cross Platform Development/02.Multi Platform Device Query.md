# Device Query on different platforms

We generate a single binary on one platform, transport it to multiple platforms *after compilation* and execute it either with .NET or Mono. 

First we see a Tesla GPU on Windows

Here, the same program is run on a Titan on Windows. Notice how this one is running the different *WDDM* as opposed to the *TCC* driver on Tesla.

Next, we run on Linux again on a Titan.

On iMac, there is now the built-in GPU in it.

And last but not least, we run on the Tegra K1 development board on an ARM processor.
