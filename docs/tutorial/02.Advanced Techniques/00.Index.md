# Advanced Techniques 

The [Quick Step Tutorial](/quick_start/index.html) introduced the most basic Alea GPU programming
technique, the so called the method based approach. It is very well suited for basic use cases
but has some limitations:

  - GPU algorithms cannot have a state
  - No support for generic programming 
  - Limited GPU resource management

We now consider more advanced programming techniques.
