# Solving the Two Dimensional Heat Equation 

Alternating direction implicit (ADI) schemes are standard techniques to solve higher dimensional PDEs.
For every time step, the ADI schemes lead to many independent linear systems for every direction, which
can be processed in parallel. For the commonly used finite difference approximation of
the spatial derivatives, these linear systems are essentially tridiagonal, and we can use a fine grained parallel
tridiagonal solver such as the [Parallel Cyclic Reduction Solver](examples/tridiag_solver/index.html).
