# Fast N-Body Simulation with ALEA.CUDA & OpenGL

This example, is motivated by [GPU Gems 3](http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems3/gpugems3_ch31.html) and shows how
you can solve a gravitational n-body system and display the bodies positions using [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) respectively [OpenTK](http://www.opentk.com/).

In order to compare, you might download a C++ implementation from the [NVidia Cuda-samples](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-samples/#cuda-n-body-simulation).

# Approximations

Parallelisation is done on a particle level, and forces are calculated between all pairs of particles (in contrast to simulations which approximate 
the force between pairs of distant particles using mean field approches, which reduce the complexity from $O(n^2)$).

The gravitational force on particle $i$ is:

$$$
\begin{equation}
    F_{i} = \sum_{1 \leq j \leq N, i \neq j} f_{ij} = G m_i \sum_{1 \leq j \leq N, i \neq j} \frac{m_j r_{ij} }{{\left||r_{ij}\right|| }^3},
\end{equation}

where $m_i$ and $m_j$ are the masses of bodies $i$ resp. $j$; $r_{ij}=x_i-x_j$ and $G$ is the gravitational constant.

We add a softening constant $\varepsilon$, which limits the amount of force two particles can exert on each other. This 
is especially important as integration is done using finite time steps and hence particles can come closer than they would otherwise. Further 
more it also makes the discrimination between the case $i = j$ and $i \neq j$ obsolete.

The force then becomes:

$$$
\begin{equation}
F_{i} \approx  \sum_{1 \leq j \leq N} G \frac{r_{ij} m_j m_i}{{\sqrt{\left||r_{ij}\right||^2 + \varepsilon^2} }^3}.
\end{equation}

# Implementation

We give three implementations of the simulation:

- a simple CPU implementation
- a GPU implementation with dynamic `blockSize`
- a GPU implementation with static `blockSize`

In addition we implemented a class `SimWindow` which visualizes the simulation using [OpenTK](http://www.opentk.com/).
