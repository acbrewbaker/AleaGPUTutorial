# cuDNN

Before starting with this tutorial you will need to download the CUDNN library [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuDNN).
The code below is a port of the C++ MNist sample which accompanies the [library](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuDNN).

The example demonstrates how to use the CUDNN library to implement forward pass. The sample loads weights and biases from a trained network, takes a few images of digits and recognizes them.  The network was trained on the MNIST dataset using [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/).  The network consists of two convolution layers, two pooling layers, one relu and two fully connected layers.  The final layer gets processed by Softmax.  cublasSgemv is used to implement the fully connected layers.
