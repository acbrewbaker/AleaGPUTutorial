# Simple Scan Implementation

The scan is an important GPU primitive. It folds an array with a binary operator starting from an initial value.
The scan operation takes a binary associative operator $\oplus$ with identity element $I$, and an array of $n$ elements
$(a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1})$ and generates the values

$$$
\begin{equation}
    (I, a_0, a_0 \oplus a_1, a_0 \oplus a_1 \oplus a_2, \ldots, a_0 \oplus a_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus a_{n-2})
\end{equation}

As an example, let $\oplus = +$ and $I = 0$ then the scan of (3, 1, 7, 0, 4, 1, 6, 3) is (0, 3, 4, 11, 11, 15, 16, 22).
Note that the length of the result vector remains the same.

What we just described is the exclusive scan. The result at index $i$ is the folding of the elements up to index $i-1$.
On the other hand, the inclusive scan is folding the elements upto and including the the current element. 

We implement a simplified version of the exclusive scan. The pseudo code of the algorithm is 

    [lang="text"]
    for d = 1 to log2 n do 
        for all k in parallel do 
             if k >= pow(2, d)  then 
                 x[k] = x[k - pow(2, d-1)] + x[k] 

where $pow(2, d) = 2^d$. The following diagram shows how the algorithm works:

The algorithm performs $O(n \log_2(n))$ addition operations. Remember that a sequential scan  performs $O(n)$ adds. Therefore, this naive 
implementation is not work-efficient. The factor of $\log_2(n)$ can have a large effect on performance. 

For a work efficient scan algorithm we refer to the article of [Marc Harris](http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems3/gpugems3_ch39.html).
We also recommend the [Udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/wiki/cs344) on parallel programming.
