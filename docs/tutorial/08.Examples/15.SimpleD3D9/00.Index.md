# Simple Direct3D9 Interop

This example demonstrates how to interop with Direct3D9. To do that, you need:

- create a worker by generating a CUDA context with special API, to enable the graphic interop. 
  It is recommended to create worker on current thread, to save the thread switching time, for
  more details, please reference [here](http://quantalea.com/static/app/manual/programming_gpu-device_and_worker.html)
- register vertex buffer as CUDA resource, and unregister them when finalizing
- map registered resources to device pointer before calling CUDA kernels, and then
  unmap them after kernel is launched
