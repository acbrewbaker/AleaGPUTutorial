# cuDNN

The example demonstrates how to use the cuDNN library to implement forward pass. The sample loads weights and biases from a trained network, takes a few images of digits and recognizes them.  The network was trained on the MNIST dataset using [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/).  The network consists of two convolution layers, two pooling layers, one relu and two fully connected layers.  The final layer gets processed by Softmax.  cublasSgemv is used to implement the fully connected layers.

## Some Notes on Preparation

Before starting with this tutorial you will need to download the cuDNN library [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuDNN).
The code below is a port of the C++ MNIST sample which accompanies the [library](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuDNN).

For the time being, NVIDIA does not provide a 32 bit version of cuDNN.  If you look at the files included with the cuDNN library download, you will only see a `cuDNN64_65.dll`.  If a 32 bit version is ever provided, e.g. `cuDNN32_65.dll`, you will not need to worry about any of these steps; Alea GPU will reference the dll according to your build configuration. Since NVIDIA only provides the 64 bit binary of cuDNN you should make sure that your .NET application is going to run as a 64 bit process.You can do this one of two ways:

  - Set your build configuration to "x64"
  - Set your build configuration to "Any CPU" and uncheck the "Prefer 32 bit" option.

It is reccommended that you edit your path environment variable to include the cuDNN installation path.  If you do not wish to do this you will need to edit the `app.config` file of your project to let Alea GPU know where your cuDNN dll can be found.

Here is a simple example of what your `app.config` file would look like.

    [lang=xml]
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
    <configuration>
      <configSections>
        <section name="aleaCUDASettings" type="Alea.CUDA.Settings, Alea.CUDA" />
      </configSections>
      <startup>
        <supportedRuntime version="v4.0" sku=".NETFramework,Version=v4.5" />
      </startup>
      <aleaCUDASettings>
        <!-- Provide your cuDNN installation path -->
        <cuDNN path="C:\Users\Me\Desktop\cudnn\" />
      </aleaCUDASettings>
    </configuration>
