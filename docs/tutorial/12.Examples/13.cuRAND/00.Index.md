# cuRAND

Here we demonstrate basic usage of the NVidia cuRAND library via AleaGPU.

If you are unfamiliar with cuRAND or any of these functions you may find

Because AleaGPU simply exposes the functionality of the cuRAND library, we suggest reviewing the NVidia documentation whenever you are designing a solution which will use cuRAND.
