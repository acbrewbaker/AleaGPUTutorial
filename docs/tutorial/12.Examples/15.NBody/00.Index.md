# Fast N-Body Simulation with Alea GPU and OpenGL

This example shows how to numerically solve the n-body problem, i.e. the simulation of Newton’s equations for many bodies or particles. The problem can be solved analytically for two particles, but in general has no analytic solution for $n>2$.

N-body simulations are often used in astronomy to study the formation of galaxies. The particles represent stars and the interacting forces are the classical Newtonian gravitational forces. Another astronomy application is the formation of moons as in [impact studies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fwl_JBQtH9o) where particles are parts of planets.

In physics, chemistry and material sciences particles represent atoms or molecules and the method is also called molecular dynamics. It often uses periodic boundary conditions to avoid strong boundary effects, and thermo- and bariostates are attached to simulate a constant temperature and/or constant pressure ensemble, see for example the [Nosé-Hoover thermostat algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nos%C3%A9%E2%80%93Hoover_thermostat).
Some interesting simulations and can be found on YouTube, such as simulation of [water vaporing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3cXuisH8PI) and [melting ice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s0b_keOiOU).

Finally, the method is applied in computer graphics to simulate explosions, the [flow of water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qve54Z71VYU), smoke and [many more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8Fo2slT2WA).

The implementation is motivated by a [GPU Gems 3 article](http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems3/gpugems3_ch31.html) and shows how
you can solve a gravitational n-body system and display the bodies' positions with [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/). You might also want to download a C++ implementation from the [NVIDIA CUDA samples](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-samples/#cuda-n-body-simulation).

## Approximations

Parallelization is done at the particle level and forces are calculated between all pairs of particles. This is in contrast to simulations which approximate the force between pairs of distant particles using a mean field approch, which reduce the $O(n^2)$ complexity at the expense of some approximation error.

The gravitational force on particle $i$ is:

$$$
\begin{equation}
    F_{i} = \sum_{1 \leq j \leq N, i \neq j} f_{ij} = G m_i \sum_{1 \leq j \leq N, i \neq j} \frac{m_j r_{ij} }{{\left||r_{ij}\right|| }^3},
\end{equation}

where $m_i$ and $m_j$ are the masses of bodies $i$ resp. $j$, $r_{ij}=x_i-x_j$ and $G$ is the gravitational constant.

We add a softening constant $\varepsilon$, which limits the amount of force two particles can exert on each other. This is especially important as integration is done using finite time steps and hence particles can come closer than they would otherwise. Further 
more it also makes the discrimination between the case $i = j$ and $i \neq j$ obsolete.

The force then simplifies to:

$$$
\begin{equation}
F_{i} \approx  \sum_{1 \leq j \leq N} G \frac{r_{ij} m_j m_i}{{\sqrt{\left||r_{ij}\right||^2 + \varepsilon^2} }^3}.
\end{equation}

Newton's equations imply conservation of energy, momentum and angular momentum. Using the wrong scheme for numerical integration, or time steps which are too large, destroys these conservation laws. Integration schemes that preserve the conservation laws are the [simplectic integrators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_integrator), e.g. [verlet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration) and the [velocity verlet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration#Velocity_Verlet) algorithm. Following NVIDIA’s example we use the following integration scheme which includes a damping term $<0$ and slightly reduces the energy in every integration step:

$$$
\begin{equation}v_{t+dt} = \rm{damping} \left(v_t + a_t dt\right), \\
x_{t+dt} = x_{t} + v_{t+dt} dt.
\end{equation}

## Implementation

We give three implementations of the simulation:

- a simple CPU implementation
- a GPU implementation with dynamic `blockSize`
- a GPU implementation with static `blockSize`

In addition we implemented a class `SimWindow` which visualizes the simulation using [OpenTK](http://www.opentk.com/).
