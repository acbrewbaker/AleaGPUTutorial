# Setting Up

## How to Get Alea GPU

Alea GPU contains individual packages which are available through [NuGet](http://www.nuget.org/profiles/quantalea). The deployment package [Alea.CUDA.Fody](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Alea.CUDA.Fody/) installs the quotation based compiler, the IL based compiler together with the ahead of time compilation tool.

## Hardware Requirements

Alea GPU requires a CUDA capable GPU with compute capability 2.0 (Fermi architecture) or higher. See NVIDIAs [CUDA GPU overview](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) to find out which products support CUDA and have a compute capability higher than 2.0.

### Software Requirements

  - Up to date NVIDIA GPU drivers supporting CUDA 6.5 or higher. 
  - IDE such as Visual Studio 2013, MonoDevelop or Xamarin Studio

## Different Platforms

Alea GPU is cross platform and can be use on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. The following sections
