# Setting up on Mac OS X

## Hardware

In general only iMac, MacBook Pro and Mac Pro machines have [CUDA capable GPUs](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus). Some of these models may have AMD GPUs which are **NOT** CUDA compatible. To see what GPU is built in your Mac, go to `About This Mac`, choose `Displays` and the GPU name will appear.

## Software

  - Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion or later
  - [Latest CUDA drivers](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
  - [Mono 64 bit](http://www.mono-project.com)
  - IDE Xamarin Studio  
	
### Installing Mono

A 64-bit Mono installation is needed because only 64-bit CUDA drivers are available for Mac OS X. Xamarin ships with its own Mono installation, althoug it is a 32-bit version, which cannot be used for Alea GPU. To install a 64-bit Mono in `/Users/YourUserName/sandbox/mono64` proceed as follows:

Download Mono [tar-ball](http://download.mono-project.com/sources/mono/) and run the following script to 
install the dependencies (assuming to install them to `/usr/local`, see [Mono web page](http://www.mono-project.com/Compiling_Mono_on_OSX/)) 

	[lang=text]
	REFIX=/usr/local

	# Ensure you have write permissions to /usr/local
	mkdir $PREFIX
	sudo chown -R `whoami` $PREFIX

	PATH=$PREFIX/bin:$PATH

	# Download and build dependencies
	mkdir ~/Build
	cd ~/Build
	curl -O ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/m4/m4-1.4.17.tar.gz
	curl -O ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/autoconf/autoconf-2.69.tar.gz
	curl -O ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/automake/automake-1.14.tar.gz
	curl -O ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libtool/libtool-2.4.2.tar.gz

	for i in *.tar.gz; do tar xzvf $i; done
	for i in */configure; do (cd `dirname $i`; ./configure --prefix=$PREFIX && make && make install); done

Run the script to install Mono 64-bit 

	[lang=text]
	tar xvf mono-3.10.0.tar.bz2
	cd mono-3.10.0
	./configure --prefix=/Users/BA-Mac-01/sandbox/mono64 --enable-nls=no
	make
	make install

Add the location of Mono to the path and define a variable `mono64` (`mono64` will be called from the build scirpt for this tutorial)

	[lang=text]
    export PATH=/Users/YourUserName/sandbox/mono64/bin:$PATH
    mono64=/home/YourUserName/sandbox/mono64/bin/mono


## Installing Xamarin

Xamarin can be downloaded from the [Xamarin web page](https://store.xamarin.com). You can choose between a free and different commercial plans. The installation is done using drag and drop.

### Install CUDA driver or CUDA Tool-kit 6.5

For profiling with [NVProf](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/profiler-users-guide/) you have to install [NVIDIA CUDA Tookit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit). Follow the instructions in [getting started for Mac OS X](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-getting-started-guide-for-mac-os-x/index.html). Note that the CUDA Toolkit also installs the CUDA drivers. Make sure your GPU is supported by this driver, otherwise you need to install a compatible [CUDA driver](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us). 

After installing the CUDA Toolkit with drag and drop, export the library path

	[lang=text]
	export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib

## Start with tutorial

Open the tutorial solution `Alea.Tutorial.Unix.sln` with Xamarin. Xamarin will restore the packages, but the solution seems to be empty:

Go to `View` and click `Visual Design` to see the folder structure of the solution.

You can compile but not run the code using Xamarin. Alternatively use the provided build script

	[lang=text]
	build.sh
	
To execute a GPU program go to the `release` folder (or `debug` folder, if compiled from Mono develop in debug mode) and launch it with Mono 64-bit

	[lang=text]
    mono64 Tutorial.Fs.exe
    mono64 Tutorial.Cs.exe

Running GPU Code using Xamarin is not possible at the moment because Xamarin uses a 32-bit distribution, which is not compatible with the 64-bit CUDA drivers for Mac.

Note that this documentation can **only be built on Windows** with build.bat.
