# Rapid Prototyping in Visual Studio

We explore the F# Interactive in Visual Studio for rapid prototyping. You find the 
F# Interactive console window under `View -> Other Windows -> F# Interactive`

## Configuring the F# Interactive

It is advisable to configure the F# Interactive to run in 64 bit mode. Select `Tools -> Options` and 
select F# Tools. Configure the F# Interactive as follows:

## Installing FsEye

Optionally install FsEye. FsEye is a visual object tree inspector for the F# Interactive. Taking advantage of the built-in WinForms event loop, it listens for additions and updates to variables within FSI sessions, allowing you to reflectively examine properties 
of captured values through a visual interface. It also allows you to programmatically add and update eye watches.

The [FsEye user gide](https://code.google.com/p/fseye/wiki/UserGuide) describes how to set up use it.
Add `--load:"C:\FsEye\FsEye.fsx"` to the F# Interactive options under `Tools -> F# Tools` to load it at startup.

It will display all your values in an F# interactive session.

## Scripting with the F# Interactive

The F# Interactive can be used to run F# code interactively at the console. Open the file `Transform.fsx` 
in the project `Tutorial.Fs` from the solution explorer.

Mark any code section you want to execute and send it to the F# Interactive with right-click and `Execute in Interactive`

The F# Interactive console window displays the values and the results. The `FSharp.Charting` library is very convenient 
to make all kind of plots to visualize the results.

Instead of explicitely referencing the assemblies as in the script `Transform.fsx`, it is also possible to send 
the referenced assemblies to the F# Interactive. Right-click the references in the solution explorer and select 
`Send References to F# Interactive`
