# Rapid Prototyping

GPU scripting and rapid prototyping are very useful to explore algorithms and play around with different implementation.

GPU scripting is a strenght of the F# language: the F# Interactive (fsi.exe) can run F# code interactively in the console 
and execute F# scripts. 

Moreover Visual Studio has an interactive console, which can be used to execute F# on the fly.
