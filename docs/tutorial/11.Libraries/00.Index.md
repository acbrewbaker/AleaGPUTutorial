# Libraries  

## Alea Unbound

Alea Unbound is a collection of performance primitives and GPU algorithms implemented directly with Alea GPU in F#.
The current version contains

  - Highly optimized performance primitives for reduce and scan
  - Matrix multiplication implemented similar as in MAGMA
  - Xorshift7, Mrg32k3a pseudo-random number generators 
  - Sobol quasi-random number generators
  - Some cumulative distribution functions and inverse cumulative distribution functions  
  - Tridiagonal solver tuned for PDE solvers

## NVIDIA cuBLAS Interface

The [NVIDIA CUDA Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuBLAS) (cuBLAS) library is a GPU-accelerated version of the complete standard BLAS library. For sufficiently large problems it delivers faster performance than the latest MKL BLAS library 
from Intel. 

We refer to the [cuBLAS documentation](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cublas/index.html) for additional details.
