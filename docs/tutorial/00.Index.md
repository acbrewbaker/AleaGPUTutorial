# GPU Software Development on .NET with Alea GPU 
  
This tutorial shows step by step how to use Alea GPU to develop GPU accelerated applications on .NET. 

The [source code](http://github.com/quantalea/AleaGPUTutorial) of the tutorial is available on GitHub.

The [quick start](quick_start/index.html) section shows how to write simple 
GPU accelerated algorithms and explains the basic Alea GPU programming concepts. 

The tutorial is complemented with a rich collection of [examples](examples/index.html) 
written in C#, F# and VB. 

If you are new to GPU computing the [background](gpu_background/index.html) section contains helpful information. 
 
Important terms and concepts are introduced in the [terminology](terminologies/index.html) section.
