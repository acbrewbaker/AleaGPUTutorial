# Run the examples in Alea GPU Tutorial

This tutorail contains a growing number of interesting examples, the sources are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/quantalea/AleaGPUTutorial).

To build on Windows, simply run `build.bat` from command-line under the solution folder (on Linux and OSX run `build.sh`). This script will execute the following steps:

- download latest `paket.exe` from Internet;
- run `paket.exe restore` to restore the packages listed in `paket.lock` file;
- build projects;
- generate documentation (only on Windows);

Then you can:

- check `docs\output\index.html` for the generated document;
- execute `release\Tutorial.FS.exe examplesnbodysimulation` to run NBody simulation written in F#.
- execute `release\Tutorial.CS.exe examplesnbodysimulation` to run NBody simulation written in C#.
- execute `release\Tutorial.FS.exe` or `release\Tutorial.CS.exe` to see more examples.
- Explore the source code with Visual Studio and run unit tests.

To build within Visual Studio, it is recommended to restore the packages before open the solution, since there is an known issue of Fody and F# project (for more details on this issue, please reference [installation manual (especially the Remarks section)](http://quantalea.com/static/app/manual/compilation-installation.html)). Please follow following steps:

- go to solution folder and restore packages:
  - `cd MySolutionFolder`
  - `.paket\paket.bootstrapper.exe`
  - `.paket\paket.exe restore`
- open solution with Visual Studio, then build solution with `Release` configuration
- set debug argument to one example, such as `examplenbodysimulation`
- run/debug the tutorial program
