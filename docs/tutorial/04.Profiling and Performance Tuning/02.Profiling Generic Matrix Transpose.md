# Profiling Generic Matrix Transpose

We now analyze the different matrix transpose versions with the Visual Profiler. 
Start Visual Profiler and choose File | New Session. Enter the path to the application and the required command line arguments

Click next to proceed. In the next dialog uncheck "Start execution with profiling enabled"

Now generate the timeline with Run | Generate Timeline

which shows how the different GPU kernels are launched. 

## Noncoalescing Memory Writes of Naive Transpose 

We use Run | Configure Metrics and Events and select the global memory load and store efficiency metrics.

Press `Apply And Run` to collect the metrics. In the details tab we see the result

Note that the global memory load is 100% for all four kernels, but the global store efficiency for 
the naive transpose kernel `transposeNaive` is just at 25%. The reason for this is the non-coalescing write to `odata` with 
a strided access pattern. 

## Shared Memory Bank Conflicts of Coalesced Transpose

Next we analyze the shared memory bank conflicts of `transposeCoalesced`. 
Ue Run | Configure Metrics and Events and select the shared load and store replay event.
Some GPU hardware directly have an event for the shared memory bank conflicts.

Press `Apply And Run` to collect the metrics. The results in the details tab 

<img src="../content/images/profileMatrixTransposeNoBankConflict.png" width="1200" alt="bank conflicts">

indicate that `transposeCoalesced` has more than 6 millions of shared load replays. This points towards
shared memory bank conflicts. The kernel `transposeNoBankConflicts` shows significantly fewer shared memory 
load and store replays.
