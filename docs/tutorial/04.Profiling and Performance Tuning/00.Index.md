# Profiling and Performance Tuning

In this section we tune a CUDA kernel in multiple steps and use 
the NVIDIA [Visual Profiler](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/profiler-users-guide) to analyze the performance
of the different implementations. 

The Visual Profiler is a graphical profiling tool that displays a timeline the application's CPU and GPU activity and can be used to identify optimization opportunities. It is part of the [NVIDIA CUDA Tookit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit).

The Visual Profiler is available as both a standalone application and also integrated in Visual Studio. Here we use the standalone
application because it gives more flexibility. 

Currently we only support [focused profiling](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/profiler-users-guide/#prepare-application), which 
means that the profile region has to be set explicitely.   


## Profiling of JIT Compiled Code

For JIT compiled GPU code set the `JITCompile.Level` to `Profiling`. This can be done in the `app.config` file

	[lang="xml"]
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
	<configuration>
	  <configSections>
	    <section name="aleaCUDASettings" type="Alea.CUDA.Settings, Alea.CUDA" />
	  </configSections>
	  <startup>
	    <supportedRuntime version="v4.0" sku=".NETFramework,Version=v4.5" />
	  </startup>
	  <aleaCUDASettings>
	    <jitCompile level="Profiling"/>
	  </aleaCUDASettings>
	</configuration>

Alternatively it can be programmatically: add an assembly reference `System.Configuration` to the project and set
`Alea.CUDA.Settings.Instance.JITCompile.Level` to the string value `"Profiling"`. Make sure that the configuration in 
`app.config` and the programmatic configuration are set at the same time. 

## Set Profile Region

In the source code you set the profile region by

	[lang="csharp"]
	worker.ProfilerStart()

and

	[lang="csharp"]
	worker.Synchronize()
    worker.ProfilerStop()

The `worker` can be obtained from a `GPUModule` instance by calling `this.GPUWorker`. 
Besides defining the profile region, the executable properties in the NVIDIA Visual Profiler 
have to be set accoringly. The option "Start execution with profiling enabled" has to be unchecked

## Next Step

We implement multiple versions of a generic matrix transpose kernel and use the Visual Profiler to
analyze the their performance characteristics.
